# defaults file for zabbix-server-sqlite3

# Start the Zabbix server from the init.d script?
# (Possible values: "yes" or "no")
#
# This is by default set to "no" because a SQLite3 database needs to be
# prepared and configured before you can start the Zabbix server for the first
# time.
#
# Instructions on how to set up the database can be found in
# /usr/share/doc/zabbix-server-sqlite3/README.Debian
START=no
